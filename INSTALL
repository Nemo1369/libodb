Prerequisites
=============

  - C++ compiler

Building on UNIX
================

The following build instructions are used for Linux/UNIX/MacOS X operating
systems as well as for Cigwin and MinGW on Windows.

The standard autotools-based build system is used on these platforms. After
unpacking the source code archive change to the libodb package directory
(referred to as libodb/ from now on) and run the configure script:

./configure

To see the available configuration options run configure with --help:

./configure --help

Here is an example configure run that creates shared libraries only using
the specified GNU C++ compiler with optimization and without the debug 
information:

./configure --disable-static CXX=g++-4.5 CXXFLAGS=-O3

Once configuration is complete, run make to build libodb:

make

If the build completes successfully, you can install the libodb headers
and libraries using the install target (you may need to do this step as 
root depending on the installation directory):

make install


Building on Windows
===================

The following build instructions are for Microsoft Visual Studio. If you
would like to build libodb with GCC either using Cigwin or MinGW, refer
to the "Building on UNIX" section above.

To build libodb with Visual Studio unpacking the source code archive and
open the libodb-vc<N>.sln file located in the libodb package directory 
(referred to as libodb\ from now on). Here N is the version of Visual
Studio that you are using. Once the solution is open, select the desired
configuration (Debug or Release) and platform (Win32 or x64) and build
the solution.

The resulting 32-bit DLLs and import libraries are placed into the 
libodb\bin\ and libodb\lib\ directories, respectively. Similarly, the
64-bit DLLs and import libraries are placed into libodb\bin64\ and
libodb\lib64\. The Release versions of import libraries are named
odb.lib and the Debug versions are named odb-d.lib.

To configure Visual Sudio to automatically locate the libodb headers,
DLLs, and import libraries, add the following paths to your VC++
Directories:

Win32:

  Inlcude:    ...\libodb
  Library:    ...\libodb\lib
  Executable: ...\libodb\bin    

x64:

  Inlcude:    ...\libodb
  Library:    ...\libodb\lib64
  Executable: ...\libodb\bin64
